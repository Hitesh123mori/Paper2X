It represents highly\\ncomplex non-linear fluctuating market behaviours where traders, investors, and organizers look forward to\\nreliable future predictions of the market indices. Such prediction problems can be computationally addressed\\nusing various machine learning, deep learning, sentiment analysis, as well as mining approaches. However,\\nthe internal parameters configuration can play an important role in the prediction performance; also, feature\\nselection is a crucial task. Therefore, to optimize such approaches, the evolutionary computation-based\\nalgorithms can be integrated in several ways.

Thus, we aim to analyse the\\npotential extensibility and adaptability of GAs for stock market prediction. We review stock price and stock\\ntrend prediction, as well as portfolio optimization, approaches over the recent years (2013–2022) to signify the\\nstate-of-the-art of GA-based optimization in financial markets. We broaden our discussion by briefly reviewing\\nother genetic perspectives and their applications for stock market forecasting. We balance our survey with the\\nconsideration of competitiveness and complementation of GAs, followed by highlighting the challenges and\\npotential future research directions of applying GAs for stock market prediction.\\nContents\\n1.\\nIntroduction ......................................................................................................................................................................................................\\n3\\n1.1.\\nMotivation.............................................................................................................................................................................................\\n3\\n1.2.\\nSurvey Strategy......................................................................................................................................................................................\\n5\\n2.\\nBackground .......................................................................................................................................................................................................\\n6\\n2.1.\\nGenetic Algorithm ..................................................................................................................................................................................\\n6\\n2.2.\\nFinancial Market Forecasting...................................................................................................................................................................\\n8\\n2.3.\\nExisting Surveys .....................................................................................................................................................................................\\n9\\n3.\\nGenetic Algorithms for Parameter Optimization....................................................................................................................................................\\n9\\n3.1.\\nOverview...............................................................................................................................................................................................\\n9\\n3.2.\\nStock Price Prediction............................................................................................................................................................................. 10\\n3.3.\\nStock Trend Prediction............................................................................................................................................................................ 11\\n3.4.\\nAn Experimental Analysis........................................................................................................................................................................ 12\\n3.5.\\nSummary ............................................................................................................................................................................................... 12\\n4.\\nGenetic Algorithms for Feature Selection ............................................................................................................................................................. 12\\n4.1.\\nOverview............................................................................................................................................................................................... 12\\n4.2.\\nStock Price Prediction............................................................................................................................................................................. 15\\n4.3.\\nStock Trend Prediction............................................................................................................................................................................ 15\\n4.4.\\nAn Experimental Analysis........................................................................................................................................................................ 16\\n4.5.\\nSummary ............................................................................................................................................................................................... 16\\n5.\\nGenetic Algorithms for Other Stock Market Applications ....................................................................................................................................... 16\\n∗Corresponding author.\\nE-mail addresses: ankit.thakkar@nirmauni.ac.in (A.

Introduction\\nThe financial market tradings emerged from banking and money\\ntransactions to stock market investments and electronic currencies. It\\nintroduced a large number of interactivity within money-related trans-\\nactions [1]. It also has a remarkable effect on the economy wherein,\\nstock market tradings have exemplified several financial aspects. Trad-\\ning can be considered as a buying and/or selling of instruments such as\\nshares, securities, futures, commodities, to name a few. Careful market\\ntradings can benefit the investors with high returns of their invest-\\nments, however, trading may not be profitable in all instances; traders\\nmay also lose a large number of valuables in the share market. Such\\ncontrary behaviour and highly volatile nature of the stock market has\\nattracted researchers, investors, and organizations to develop reliable\\nstock market predictions.\\nStock market forecasting primarily includes prediction of stock price\\nand stock trend to derive future market expectations and risks; here,\\nstock trend is the directional movement of stock prices that predicts\\nwhether the price would be higher or lower than the previous price\\nvalue, i.e., whether the trend would be up or down, respectively. On\\nthe other hand, such risks can be distributed among various stocks in\\norder to create a portfolio, which is expected to generate an overall\\nprofit; optimization of such a portfolio can be a challenging task [2].\\nHence, market analysis can be a critical responsibility. The fundamental\\nanalysis considers qualitative market information such as organization\\nprofiles, strategies along with quantitative stock data information such\\nas price indices, volume, etc. [3]; identification of potential trading\\nusing fundamental knowledge demands expertise whereas the technical\\nanalysis works with stock features and technical indicators. Prior work\\non stock market forecasting using computational intelligence largely\\ncovered various machine learning, deep learning, and data mining\\ntechniques along with opinion mining and sentiment analysis. For such\\na computation-based approach, selection of an appropriate method\\ncan be a major concern, followed by parameter tuning and features\\nidentification to enhance the prediction accuracy. Nature-inspired al-\\ngorithms emerged as a branch, comprising of evolutionary algorithms\\nsuch as genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), as well\\nas swarm intelligence-based methods such as ant colony optimization\\n(ACO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant lion optimization (ALO),\\nto name a few. These approaches are designed to computerize the\\nproblem-solving capabilities of nature. Various swarm and evolutionary\\nalgorithms have been applied to applications belonging to diverse do-\\nmains [4–8] for algorithmic parameters optimization, feature selection\\nfrom a large set of variables, classification, as well as near-optimal\\nsolution identification for highly complex problems. The potential ap-\\nplications of such approaches to financial domains such as financial\\ncrisis prediction using ACO [9], stock market prediction and portfolio\\noptimization using PSO [2], etc. have also been observed. Hence, it\\nis important to study the possible implications of such algorithms on\\nstock market prediction. This article focuses on one of the evolutionary\\nalgorithms, GA, and its related perspectives in order to analyse its\\napplicability to stock market forecasting. The rationale behind con-\\nsidering GA is its parallel search ability and treatment capability for\\ncomplex optimization problems; it is able to address the limitations\\nof neural networks (NNs) such as slow convergence and being stuck\\nin local optima [10]. Hence, a dedicated review article is desirable to\\ndemonstrate how GAs can be adapted for financial forecasting. The pre-\\nsented survey addresses the following research questions (RQs) based\\non the integration of GAs for specific real-world problems associated\\nwith stock market prediction.\\n(RQ1): Why should genetic algorithm, as well as its related perspec-\\ntives, be applied to stock market prediction?\\n(RQ2): How can genetic algorithms be integrated with various compu-\\ntational methods for stock market prediction?\\n(RQ3): What are the different ways in which other approaches can be\\nhybridized with genetic algorithms for stock market prediction?\\n(RQ4): Which are the other metaheuristic approaches that compete\\nwith genetic algorithms and how competitive are they for stock\\nmarket prediction?\\nThis article provides an organized approach to study GAs, as well as\\nother genetic perspectives, for a focused application on complex stock\\nmarket forecasting. A systematic overview of this survey article using\\nGAs for stock market prediction is as shown in Fig. 1 and potential\\nsolutions to the listed RQs are discussed in the following sections. Based\\non the no free lunch theorems, it has been proven that ‘‘no search\\nalgorithm is superior to any other algorithm on average across all\\npossible problems’’ [11]. Thus, it is of critical importance to understand\\nhow GAs and their related genetic perspectives behave to solve the\\nfinancial forecasting problems; our primary aim to conduct this survey\\nis to understand how the search bias of GAs can be matched with the\\nregularities and patterns present in stock market prediction problems.\\n1.1.

The non-linear market behaviour demands adaptable methods\\nto handle fluctuating data [13]. One of the evolutionary approaches,\\nGA, is inspired by inherent parallelism while searching for the fittest\\nsolutions; such an approach can be favourable for complex time-series\\nstock market data [14]. Generating a profitable prediction can be\\nbeneficial to investors as well as organizations. Various research ar-\\nticles demonstrate applications of different evolutionary computation\\ntechniques for financial optimization, however, the advances in genetic\\nperspectives for the financial market demand a detailed study of the\\nstate-of-the-art.\\nIn this article, we conduct a focused survey on GA-based stock\\nmarket prediction approaches. Our primary motivation behind electing\\nGA for such a designated survey is its heuristic search capabilities. Some\\nof the inevitable reasons to adopt GA for various applications including\\nstock market prediction can be listed as follows.\\n• Reliability and speed in solving difficult problems [15–17]\\n• Compatibility with current simulations and models [18]\\n• Search ability in trying to avoid local minima by searching several\\nregions simultaneously [8,19]\\n• Extensibility [20,21]\\n• Adaptability to be used in combination with other algorithms [18]\\n• Not requiring gradient information [19]\\nThe highly complex financial market forecasting can be a challeng-\\ning task; while several events can influence the stock market, it is of\\ncritical importance to understand how the markets can be predicted.\\nThe nature-inspired GAs can provide a potential medium to prepare\\na compatible environment for the prediction model due to its search\\nability and evolution strategy. Also, GA encoding techniques can be\\nhelpful in formulating the given optimization problem. Other genetic\\nperspectives include genetic programming (GP), gene expression pro-\\ngramming (GEP), genetic network programming (GNP), to name a few;\\nthe variations in GAs along with related approaches have largely been\\nexplored for several real-world problems including financial market\\nforecasting. As an extension of GA, GP is a systematic approach to\\ntransform the given computational aspects into programs using genetic\\noperations in an iterative manner [22]. The evolutionary nature of GP\\ncan be utilized to address the non-linear price movements of the stock\\nmarkets [23]; it can be adapted as a simulating mechanism for financial\\ntrading [24].\\nSubsequently, GEP can be viewed as an expression tree-based\\ngenome representation that is capable of adaptation and evolution [25,\\n26]. It can be viewed as an adaptation of linear structures of GAs as\\nwell as tree structures of GPs [27], and hence, it can be further applied\\nto various dynamic problems such as stock market prediction [28].\\nAs compared to the string structure of GA and the tree structure of\\nGP, a network-based genome representation has also been developed\\nas a GNP for modelling dynamic environments [29]. For example,\\nthe trading rules can be iteratively updated based on the change in\\nmarket behaviours which, in turn, can become beneficial for portfolio\\noptimization [30,31]. Here, the re-usability of nodes provides com-\\npactness of structure; also, the history of node transitions can affect\\nthe current nodes and hence, it can serve as an implicit memory\\nfunction that can be useful in addressing complex applications [32].\\nThe characteristics of various genetic perspectives can be customized\\nto develop computational approaches that can solve financial problems\\nand thus, it serves as a primary motivation to apply GA, as well as its\\nrelated perspectives, to stock market prediction (RQ1). In this article,\\nwe conduct a focused survey with GAs being the centre of interest to\\naddress various financial problems such as stock price forecasting, stock\\ntrend prediction, optimal portfolio identification, etc. and we discuss\\ndifferent ways in which GAs have been incorporated into financial\\nmarket applications.\\n1.2. Survey Strategy\\nIn this survey, we aim to cover the applications of GA in financial\\nmarkets. To conduct a systematic survey, we carried out a step-wise\\nstrategy to collect a set of articles closely related to our main focus\\nof this survey. We initialized our search with Google Scholar website\\nwith the search terms ‘‘stock’’, ‘‘prediction’’, and ‘‘genetic algorithm’’.\\nWe restricted the articles between years 2013 and 2022 to ensure that\\nthe most recent advances could be collected. The search was further\\nmodified to include ‘‘stock price’’, ‘‘stock trend’’, and ‘‘stock market’’\\nterms individually with ‘‘prediction’’ as well as ‘‘forecasting’’ terms\\nand the combination of such terms were given along with ‘‘genetic\\nalgorithm’’. We also extended the search with ‘‘portfolio optimization’’\\nto cover the same as a potential GA application. Further, we detailed\\nour search based on the way in which GAs were applied for specific\\nstock market applications; for this purpose, we considered query terms\\nsuch as ‘‘parameter tuning’’, ‘‘parameter optimization’’, ‘‘feature selec-\\ntion’’, and ‘‘rule selection’’ to derive application-specific articles. We\\nalso searched with ‘‘hybrid’’, ‘‘ensemble’’, and ‘‘fusion’’ terms to derive\\na set of possible applications of GAs. Hence, the initial queries given to\\nGoogle Scholar search engine were as follows.\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚)\\n• (𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑓𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑜(𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑂𝑅𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟(𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑂𝑅𝑡𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔)) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐\\n𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘) 𝐴𝑁𝐷((𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑂𝑅𝑟𝑢𝑙𝑒) 𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(ℎ𝑦𝑏𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑂𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑚𝑏𝑙𝑒)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑔𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑡ℎ𝑚) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑓𝑢𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑥𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔)\\n• (𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛) 𝐴𝑁𝐷(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔)\\nIt has been observed that the genetic-based computational devel-\\nopments are not only restricted to GAs; therefore, we repeated the\\nsearch queries by replacing ‘‘genetic algorithm’’ term with ‘‘genetic\\nprogramming’’, ‘‘gene expression programming’’, and ‘‘genetic network\\nprogramming’’ terms for the said duration, i.e., 2013–2022. To pro-\\nvide a state-of-the-art survey, we also considered the competitiveness\\nand complementation of GAs and therefore, we searched for articles\\nhaving been discussing other swarm and evolutionary computation\\ntechniques along with GAs, such as ‘‘particle swarm optimization’’,\\n‘‘butterfly optimization algorithm’’, ‘‘ant colony optimization’’, ‘‘har-\\nmony search’’, etc. While a large number of optimization algorithms\\nhave been individually applied to stock market prediction, our main\\nconsideration with this survey is to demonstrate the significance of\\nGAs and other genetic perspectives; to conduct a fair comparison, we\\nensured that the selected articles should have compared GAs with other\\nmetaheuristics for stock market applications. Among the searched and\\ncollected articles, further inclusion/exclusion criteria were also applied;\\nit was observed that the considered search queries also retrieved results\\nincluding other models based on housing price, oil price, electricity\\nprice, cutting-stock problem, to name a few. The applications of GAs\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n5\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nFig. 1.

Hence, our aim\\nwas to ensure that the articles having major relevance to our survey\\nof interest were included and the articles having deviation from the\\nrationale of conducting this survey were excluded. The final collection\\nof articles were further categorized, reviewed, and included in the\\nspecific section of our survey. The year-wise percentage distribution of\\nthe considered research articles based on GA and genetic perspectives\\nfor various stock market applications in our survey is graphically\\nrepresented in Fig. 2.\\nThe remaining article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we\\nprovide a brief overview of GAs, broadly highlight some of the finan-\\ncial applications addressed using GAs, and showcase how our survey\\nconcentrates on stock market applications as compared to the exist-\\ning surveys; we describe parameter optimization based on GAs and\\nreview existing stock price prediction and stock trend prediction-based\\napproaches in Section 3; in Section 4, we discuss how GAs can be used\\nfor feature selection and review existing approaches based on stock\\nprice prediction and stock trend prediction; we extend our survey based\\non the applications of GAs for portfolio optimization as well as other\\nfinancial market applications in Section 5; we explore stock market\\nforecasting addressed using other genetic perspectives in Section 6; we\\nbalance our survey with the discussion on competitiveness of other\\nswarm and evolutionary computation with respect to GAs, as well\\nas complementation of GAs, in Section 7; in Section 8, we analyse\\nchallenges related to stock markets as well as potential future research\\ndirections; we conclude our survey in Section 9.\\n2. Background\\nNature has inspired the development of various evolutionary al-\\ngorithms. GA is one of the metaheuristics developed to computerize\\nthe natural selection procedure so as to generate near-optimal solu-\\ntions [19]. Due to its ability to work within a dynamic and highly\\ncomplex environment, many stock market-based forecasting techniques\\nconsidered GAs for stock price and movement direction prediction [33,\\n34]. These broad fields can be further exploited based on GA applica-\\ntions such as parameter optimization, feature selection, and classifica-\\ntion.\\n2.1. Genetic Algorithm\\nThe natural selection is claimed to be ‘‘the only acceptable expla-\\nnation for the genesis and maintenance of adaptation’’ [35]; it can\\nbe understood as survival and reproduction of individuals. GA was\\ndeveloped for large search spaces with a fitness objective. The param-\\neter encodings, i.e., chromosomes, are presented in the form of strings\\nthat collectively create a population; it carries forward the principle of\\nsurvival of the fittest and evolves using various genetic operations [36].\\nMotivation from the biological aspects introduces generation of new\\noffsprings from the parent chromosomes using crossover and mutation\\noperations.\\nGAs aim to continue evolving so as to attain the fittest possible solu-\\ntions; the iterative steps of GAs, i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation,\\ncan be visualized using Figs. 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Here, for simplic-\\nity of understanding and clarity in visualization, the chromosomes of\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n6\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nFig. 2.

As it can\\nbe seen from the illustrations, the initial population may be selected\\nrandomly to represent chromosomes; these chromosome strings, also\\nknown as genotypes, are made up of values such that they can be\\npotential solutions to the given problem. In order to select the parent\\nchromosomes from the given population, a fitness function (𝑓(𝑥)) is\\nchosen and each chromosome is evaluated to identify fittest solutions;\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n7\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nFig. 5. An illustration of mutation operation using genetic algorithm. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version\\nof this article.)\\nFig. 3 illustrates how chromosomes are selected based on their fitness\\nvalues. A crossover operation is applied on the selected chromosomes\\nin the next step; based on the way in which the crossover point(s)\\nis(are) selected, the selected parent chromosomes are divided and genes\\nof one chromosome are swapped with that of the other chromosome.\\nIn Fig. 4, the crossover points are demonstrated using vertical dashed\\nlines; here, Chromosome 1 and Chromosome 2 present single-point\\ncrossover whereas Chromosome 3 and Chromosome 4 denote multi-\\npoint crossover. The new offsprings are generated and carried forward\\nfor the next step wherein mutation operation is performed. As shown\\nin Fig. 5, certain genes can be mutated with a different value from the\\nset of possible values; these mutated gene positions are illustrated in\\ncomparatively darker shades than their previous colours. The fitness of\\nsuch mutated offsprings can be further evaluated based on the fitness\\nfunction and a set of chromosomes can be selected to serve as parent\\nchromosomes in the next generation. These operations can be repeated\\nuntil the termination criterion is met and the fittest possible solution\\ncan be adopted for the given problem. It can be observed that through\\neach generation, the genetic representation of the fittest chromosome\\ncan vary based on various operations; the randomly selected crossover\\npoint(s) can decide the swapping of respective parent strings during\\ncrossover whereas one or more points may be flipped or changed during\\nmutation in order to maintain genetic diversity. These operations are\\nperformed for avoiding the algorithm to be trapped into local minima\\ndue to a large number of chromosome similarities [37]. While pre-\\ndicting through fluctuating stock market characteristics, the targetted\\napproach requires to develop reliable predictions. Such predictions\\nare likely to be influenced by algorithmic parameters, features, and\\noperational aspects. Instead of manually selecting the model and its\\nconfigurations, bio-inspired approaches can be adopted. Similarly, the\\nnatural selection ability of GA can be exploited to solve an optimization\\nproblem. It can be suitable for stock prediction because of its capacity\\nto deal with the complexity of a large number of possible combi-\\nnations [38]. The stock market complexities have attracted various\\nresearchers to resolve forecasting problems and GAs have been applied\\nto financial market forecasting applications in distinguished manners.\\nThe following section broadly describes the extensibility of GAs to\\nsolve various financial problems. Also, it is essential to study the need\\nfor a state-of-the-art survey, majorly concentrated on GAs and their\\napplications to stock markets; for this purpose, we review the existing\\nsurveys and showcase the importance of conducting this survey. We\\nalso provide a comparative discussion on the coverages of the existing\\nsurveys as compared to our survey article.\\n2.2. Financial Market Forecasting\\nThough our survey majorly focuses on GA-based stock price and\\nstock trend prediction techniques, it is noteworthy to mention that a\\nlarge number of related financial applications are also addressed using\\nGAs.\\nIn financial aspects, traders may desire to derive reliable predic-\\ntions as well as interpretable rules that may be followed in order to\\ngain profits from their investment. A time horizon structure, (1, 5, 22),\\nwas found to be followed by different applications of heterogeneous\\nautoregressive (HAR) models; it defined 1 day (daily), 5 days (weekly),\\nand 22 days (monthly) trading frequencies for the developed mar-\\nket. Considering that traders belonging to different backgrounds may\\nhave diverse investment behaviours, authors proposed to optimize such\\ntime horizon structure using GA based on an adaptive HAR model of\\nrealized volatility [39]. Subsequently, an 𝑛th order fuzzy time-series\\nforecasting model was developed in [40]; authors proposed to apply GA\\nto select fuzzy lagged variables that could significantly explain fuzzy\\nrelationships. A recent application optimized fuzzy backpropagation\\nneural network (BPNN) using GA to forecast Indonesian stock exchange\\ncomposite index [41].\\nThe company finances as well as operations can be analysed using\\nfinancial ratios. In [42], authors categorized such ratios into liquidity,\\nsolvency, growth, cash-flow, operational, profitability, capital struc-\\nture, and others to predict financial distress using a GA-based wrapper\\napproach. Here, financial distress represented a company’s economic\\ninability to fulfil the debt requirements [43] which could be a crucial\\naspect associated with the financial markets. Similarly, bankruptcy can\\nbe a critical situation; it is based on the assessment of the ongoing\\nfinancial status of the company and determination of the probability of\\na company facing bankruptcy. A GA-based two-step classification ap-\\nproach was proposed to forecast bankruptcy in [44]; authors proposed\\nto use GA for feature selection of individual classifiers and performed\\nweight-based classifier evaluation for prediction. One of the recent\\napplications of GA was proposed for credit scoring for the financial\\nindustry [45]; authors proposed an enhanced multi-population niche\\nGA (EMPNGA) and integrated for feature as well as classifier selection.\\nOther potential application is portfolio optimization using GAs [46],\\nstock usage optimization [47], to name a few. The augmented GA was\\nconsidered with ANN for forecasting efficiency of monthly stock in-\\ndices [48]; authors considered eight influential macroeconomic factors\\nand seven commonly observed technical indicators as determinants in\\ntheir proposed approach. One of the recent approaches integrated con-\\nstrained gene representation of GA to identify the abnormal situations\\nusing outlier time points [49]; authors determined the anomalous time\\npoints associated with companies by applying an interpretability model\\nfor potential risk assessment. GA was also proposed for conducting a\\nvolume weighted average price (VWAP) trading [50]. The applications\\nof GA was also extended to regularized Kalman filter for asset pricing\\nmodels [51], to extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for determining\\nthe drift tendency of stock’s cumulative abnormal return [52], to name\\na few. Hence, it can be observed that various optimization, as well as\\nprediction problems of financial domains, are addressed using GAs.\\nThe growing popularity of GAs in the field of solving problems\\nfrom the financial domains requires a comprehensive survey on GAs,\\nas well as various genetic perspectives; the following sections primarily\\nconcentrate on the applications of GAs for stock market forecasting\\napplications, largely covering stock price prediction, stock trend pre-\\ndiction, and portfolio optimization. These sections address RQ2 based\\non how GAs can be integrated with different computational approaches\\nfor parameter optimization, feature selection, trading rules, and other\\nstock market applications. For the completeness of GAs associated with\\nstock market-related problems, we also include how other swarm and\\nevolutionary computation techniques can complement GAs through\\nfusion, ensemble, and/or hybrid techniques (RQ3) and how GAs have\\na competition against other metaheuristics (RQ4).\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n8\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\n2.3. Existing Surveys\\nFor complex economics applications, a Pareto-optimal solution can\\nbe derived such that the state of the allocated resources cannot be\\nmodified without declining one or more criteria. The same can be\\ndesired while solving time-series data problems such as stock market\\nprediction. While GAs are associated with a large number of research\\ndomains [53], a part of the existing literature reviewed various GA-\\nbased methods and their applications for different stock market-related\\nprediction problems.\\nVarious multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) includ-\\ning GA were studied in [54] for financial applications. Based on an\\nevolutionary multi-objective optimization domain, authors considered\\nportfolio optimization problems and other applications such as finan-\\ncial time-series, stock ranking, risk-return analysis, decision-support\\ntools, and economic modelling. Also, potential fields for further re-\\nsearch such as appropriate model discovery, data mining, stock price\\nforecasting, as well as risk management were suggested. On the other\\nhand, ANN variations were focused to review stock market predictions\\nin [55]; authors also included GA-based ANN approaches to provide\\nan introductory reviewed material using NNs for the stock market.\\nAnother survey on bio-inspired computing for stock market prediction\\nincluded GAs along with other swarm and evolutionary computation\\ntechniques [56]. In [57], authors considered fundamental and technical\\nanalyses to analyse the existing forecasting methods; some of the\\nlimitations of such methods were identified as well as the need for\\nconsidering influential input variables such as political and economic\\nfactors for reliable stock prediction was discussed. Subsequently, dif-\\nferent finance and accounting applications that were addressed using\\nNNs, fuzzy logic, and GA were analysed in [58] over the years 2007–\\n2014; while stock exchanges and portfolio management-related work\\nwere significantly presented using computational intelligence, authors\\nalso discussed the limited development of hybrid methods for the\\nsame. Specifically for portfolio optimization, various techniques were\\nsurveyed in [46]; authors directed potential research towards suitable\\nintegration of fundamental and technical analyses as well as economical\\naspects. Other surveys on text mining-based financial market prediction\\nover the years 2000–2016 [59] and time-series prediction [14] were\\nconducted. A survey was dedicated to reviewing diverse applications\\nof GAs in operation management tasks including some of the financial\\naspects over the years 2007–2017 [60]. Two of the recent surveys were\\nconducted on stock market forecasting based on prediction as well as\\nclassification techniques over the years 2010–2018 [61] and based on\\ncomputational intelligence [62]; though the coverage of topics in these\\narticles were dedicated to stock prediction, a little attention was given\\nto the genetic perspectives. Thus, it is essential to conduct a systematic\\nsurvey on the applicability of GAs for stock market prediction.\\nTable 1 demonstrates a comparative analysis of our survey with\\nthe existing surveys related to GA and its application to the financial\\nmarket; various criteria include development of genetic perspectives\\nsuch as GA, GP, GNP, and GEP in existing surveys along with the year-\\nwise coverage in respective surveys; review of different stock market\\napplications such as price or trend prediction; approaches such as\\nparameter optimization, feature selection, and hybrid techniques, as\\nwell as other related aspects in the stock market prediction. Based on\\nGAs and Darwinian approaches, several financial applications including\\nmarket forecasting were surveyed in [33]; this survey covered arti-\\ncles till year 2015. Subsequently, a bibliometric analysis of GAs was\\nconducted in [53]; also, operational management applications of GAs\\nwere reviewed in [60]. Hence, a focused survey on the recent updates,\\nas well as limitations and future directions for GA-based stock price\\nand stock trend prediction requires attention. Therefore our survey\\nprimarily focuses on the recent implications between years 2013 and\\n2022 for GA-based stock market prediction. We believe this concise\\nsurvey can be useful to study genetics-based evolutionary methods and\\ntheir applications in the financial markets.\\nTable 1\\nComparative analysis of our survey with existing stock-related surveys based on GA\\nunder various criteria: C1 — Genetic algorithm (GA), C2 — Parameter optimization,\\nC3 — Feature selection, C4 — Rule selection, C5 — Stock price prediction, C6 — Stock\\ntrend prediction, C7 — Portfolio optimization, C8 — Genetic programming (GP), C9\\n— Gene expression programming (GEP), C10 — Genetic network programming (GNP),\\nC11 — Other approaches.\\nCriteria (→)\\nC1\\nC2\\nC3\\nC4\\nC5\\nC6\\nC7\\nC8\\nC9\\nC10\\nC11\\nReference (↓)\\n[54]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[55]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[56]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[57]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[58]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[46]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[59]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[14]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[60]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n[61]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nOur survey\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\n3. Genetic Algorithms for Parameter Optimization\\nThe representative facilities provided by GAs can be extensively\\nadopted by various applications. The chromosomes can be designed to\\naddress one of the major concerns in prediction models, i.e., parameter\\noptimization. In this section, we briefly illustrate how GAs can be\\nintegrated for tuning and optimizing the parameters; we also review the\\npotential ways in which GAs are adapted for parameter optimization in\\nthe field of stock price and stock trend prediction.\\n3.1. Overview\\nIn computational approaches, selection of the model parameters is\\na crucial task; a set of parameters can largely affect the performance\\nof the given model [63]. The initial parameter values can be randomly\\nselected or combinations can be made using greedy algorithm [64]. In\\ncontrast to random or time-consuming greedy search-based approaches,\\nan adaptive, population-based heuristic search algorithm can be inte-\\ngrated to optimize parameters of the prediction model. GAs are applied\\nto a wide range of forecasting model architectures where parameter-\\ntuning plays a vital role. Here, the chromosomes are designed to\\nrepresent the given parameter(s); these values can be in the form of\\nbinary or real-valued numbers that undergo selection, crossover, and\\nmutation operations. The selection of the parent chromosomes are\\nbased on the defined fitness function and new offsprings are generated\\nthrough iterations. To provide an illustrative representation of chro-\\nmosomes that present sets of parameters, for example, we consider\\nbinary-encoded random strings and demonstrate GA operations using\\nFigs. 6, 7, 8, and 9; here, we take an example of a set of three param-\\neters, presented in binary values, however, real-valued parameters, as\\nwell as different number of parameters, can be represented similarly.\\nAs it can be viewed from Fig. 6, the considered binary strings,\\ni.e., chromosomes, are representations of parameters; these chromo-\\nsomes further undergo crossover and mutation operations as shown in\\nFigs. 7 and 8, respectively, and generate new offsprings. The newly\\ngenerated offsprings can be similarly presented in the form of sets of\\nparameters as given in Fig. 9; comparison of the same with parameter\\nvalues before GA operations (Fig. 6) indicates that certain values are\\nmodified after one generation. The fitness of these offsprings can be\\nevaluated against the given fitness function and a set of fitter solutions\\ncan further serve as parent chromosomes. This process can be carried\\nout until the given termination criterion is met and hence, a set of\\nparameters are derived in the form of the fittest chromosome. The same\\ncan be adapted to optimize parameters of various models. While finan-\\ncial markets are largely associated with historical time-series data and\\nan enormous number of ongoing events, identification of appropriate\\nparameters for the considered model and optimization can be carried\\nout using GA.\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n9\\nA.

Stock Price Prediction\\nThe stock market provides an opportunity to trade over multiple\\nexchanges; basic information of a specific stock for the trading day\\ngenerally provides the open and close prices, the highest and the\\nlowest prices attained, and a total number of tradings carried out,\\ni.e., volume. Various technical indicators, for example, simple moving\\naverage (SMA), stochastic oscillator (SO), etc. can be derived using\\nsuch information to analyse the market perspectives. To predict stock\\nprice for a short-term period (e.g., inter-day, one-day-ahead), as well\\nas a long-term period (e.g., weekly, monthly), GAs have been adopted\\nin different approaches. GA can be integrated to tune parameters of\\nthe prediction models. Considering it as one of the major applications\\nof GAs, we discuss how the ability and compatibility of GAs can be\\nextended for solving complex problems such as stock price prediction.\\nANNs have been largely used for stock price prediction. ANN param-\\neters such as neuron weight, bias value, number of hidden layers and\\nnumber of neurons in each hidden layer can be varied to construct an\\noptimal configuration for the prediction. An automatic design of ANN\\nwas carried out using GA, DE, as well as estimation of distribution al-\\ngorithms (EDA) for several time-series data in [65]; one of the datasets\\nwas Dow-Jones industrial average (DJIA) wherein the integration of\\nGA was demonstrated to perform well. Another application of GA was\\ndemonstrated with fuzzy time-series in [66] to predict stock prices\\nas well as trend. A collaborative combination of ANN and GA was\\nproposed in [19] with United States dollar (USD) market price, gold\\ncoin bubbling price, world price of an ounce of 24 carat gold, and OPEC\\noil price to be independent network input variables whereas Tehran\\nstock exchange index as a dependent variable. For a hyperbolic tangent\\nsigmoid activation function of ANN, GA with tournament selection and\\nroot-mean-square error (RMSE) fitness function, as given by Eq. (1),\\nwas adopted to optimize network parameters.\\n𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸=\\n√∑𝑁\\n𝑖=1( ̂𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖)2\\n𝑁\\n(1)\\nwhere, 𝑦𝑖and ̂𝑦𝑖indicated the actual value and output value of the\\n𝑖th data, respectively; 𝑁represented the total number of data wherein\\nthe results indicated less than 5% prediction error. Similarly, a GA-\\nbased ANN approach was proposed by considering a large number of\\noscillations experienced by the time-series data [67]. The average data\\nfluctuations for the previously observed days were considered and con-\\nnection weights were optimized using the neighbourhood replicator;\\nthe discretized features were given as inputs to ANN for Dhaka stock\\nexchange (DSE). Some of the drawbacks of a multi-layer perceptron\\n(MLP) such as slow convergence, higher computational overhead, or\\nlarger memory requirements could be targetted using a higher order\\nNN approach [68]. The results derived for predicting the last traded\\nprice, the lowest price, and the highest price were improved; also, the\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n10\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nweekly prediction for last traded price attained an average error rate of\\n1.038 [67]. One of the recent approaches applied GA to optimize the\\nweights of a feed forward neural network (FFNN) [69]; the optimized\\nmodel was further used to predict the stock close price.\\nAn adaptive single-layer second order neural network (ASONN) was\\nproposed for one-day-ahead stock close price prediction [70]; it was\\nintended to provide non-linear decision boundaries, fast convergence,\\nand high fault tolerance whereas GA was used to optimize NN parame-\\nters due to its large search space capability. With an elitism method,\\ni.e., preservation of the best parent chromosomes in a mating pool,\\nfollowed by a binary tournament selection and uniform crossover, GA\\nwas applied to achieve global optimum NN weight and bias values. The\\nmean absolute error (MAE) of the predicted stock closing price was\\nevaluated using Eq. (2).\\n𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1\\n𝑀\\n𝑀\\n∑\\n𝑗=1\\n(\\n1\\n𝑁\\n𝑁\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n|𝑦𝑖−̂𝑦𝑖|\\n)\\n(2)\\nHere, in Eq. (2), 𝑦𝑖and ̂𝑦𝑖indicated the actual value and output value\\nof the 𝑖th data, respectively; 𝑀represented number of simulations for\\nthe given experiment. Also, the percentage performance gain (PG) was\\ncalculated for the proposed second order neural network (SONN) by\\nEq. (3).\\n𝑃𝐺=\\n𝑀𝐴𝐸𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙−𝑀𝐴𝐸𝑆𝑂𝑁𝑁𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙\\n𝑀𝐴𝐸𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑚𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑙\\n× 100\\n(3)\\nSubsequently, a single hidden layer FFNN, extreme learning ma-\\nchine (ELM) was adopted with nature-inspired approaches to predict\\none-day-ahead stock price [71]. For various numbers of inputs, acti-\\nvation functions and the respective number of neurons in the hidden\\nlayer were determined using GA, DE, PSO, and weighted superposition\\nattraction (WSA). Here, GA was adopted with a stochastic uniform\\nselection and experiments were carried out among different activation\\nfunctions; various evaluation metrics were considered wherein the\\nproposed approaches improved the prediction performance.\\nWhile NNs have fixed parameters and learn accordingly, polyno-\\nmial neural networks (PNNs) are capable of exploiting different order\\npolynomials. Also, the number of input variables can vary in partial\\ndescriptions (PDs); they are selected so as to provide the optimal clas-\\nsification [72]. Such flexibility can be utilized for complex stock data. A\\ncondensed PNN (CPNN) architecture was developed by optimizing the\\nweight vectors and biases using binary encoding-based GA [72] which\\nused elitism and binary tournament selection strategies along with a\\nuniform crossover operator. The proposed CPNN-GA model evaluated\\nfitness as given by Eq. (4) and generated PDs with degree two and four,\\nrespectively, for the two hidden layers.\\n𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠= |𝑦−̂𝑦|\\n(4)\\nwhere, 𝑦and ̂𝑦indicated the target and the predicted outputs, respec-\\ntively. Comparison of gradient descent (GD)-based CPNN-GD, MLP-GD,\\nMLP-GA, and radial basis functional neural network (RBFNN) models\\nindicated the efficiency of CPNN-GA.\\nDue to the long-term dependencies of stock price data, BPNN may\\nnot be suitable for financial time-series forecasting. Though a recurrent\\nneural network (RNN)-based long short-term memory (LSTM) approach\\nhas achieved significant results in predicting stock price, its slow oper-\\national speed and inability to meet market changes could be observed.\\nSuch internal gate performances of LSTM were enhanced with GA-\\nbased weight optimization in [73]; the proposed approach was applied\\nto predict short-term stock price.\\nThe linear interdependencies of various time-series data can provide\\nuseful information. The influence of various stock information, as well\\nas the correlations, can be derived to study the evolution of variable\\nassociated with financial market. One of such stochastic processes is\\nvector autoregression (VAR); in [74], authors inherited VAR models for\\nstock closing price and compared the estimation performance achieved\\nusing conditional least square (CLS) and GA. The fitness function, mean\\nabsolute percentage error (MAPE) was calculated using Eq. (5).\\n𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸= 1\\n𝑁\\n𝑁\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n|||\\n𝑦𝑖−̂𝑦𝑖\\n𝑦𝑖\\n||| × 100\\n(5)\\nwhere, 𝑦𝑖and ̂𝑦𝑖indicated the actual value and output value of the 𝑖th\\ndata, respectively; 𝑁represented the total number of data.\\nOn the other hand, fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) had shown that\\nit required less number of instances to derive useful predictions [75].\\nAlso, the adaptability of such a system for a highly fluctuating stock\\nmarket was demonstrated in various studies [75–77]. A case study\\non stock prediction was developed with Mamdani-type FRBS in [18].\\nAuthor proposed to develop a knowledge base (KB) with a set of fuzzy\\nlinguistic rules; while rule base (RB) of KB represented symbolic form\\nof such rules, data base (DB) of KB consisted of the sets of linguistic\\nterms as well as the membership information. Hence, an evolutionary\\nfuzzification of RIPPER, i.e., repeated incremental pruning to produce\\nerror reduction, for regression (EFRiR) problems was developed; while\\nRIPPER was integrated for rule induction of RB, GA was adopted to\\noptimize DB with triangular membership function (MF). The fitness\\nof the chromosomes, equivalent of FRBSs, was evaluated using MAPE\\nas given by Eq. (5). Author proposed to copy the best 10% of the\\nchromosomes to an elitism set in order to preserve them from being\\naffected by the crossover and mutation procedures. The proposed EFRiR\\napproach was tested against various stock indices.\\nThe stock market fluctuations are one of the major challenges for\\ntraders as well as researchers. In order to predict such fluctuations\\nin stock market index, a multi-channel convolutional neural network\\n(CNN)-based approach was proposed in Ref. [78]; authors aimed to\\noptimize the feature extraction module of CNN and therefore, GA\\nwas adopted to optimize the hyperparameters. Another application\\nof GA-based parameter optimization was demonstrated on variational\\nmode decomposition (VMD) [79]; authors proposed to integrate GA to\\noptimize the parameters of VMD such that the financial data sequences\\nwere decomposed into short-term and long-term trends. These values\\nwere provided to an LSTM model to predict the financial price. Thus,\\na GA-VMD-LSTM (GVL) model was developed and selection of VMD\\nparameters were guided using VMD-loss and parameter choosing rule;\\nauthors also adopted BPNN to map prediction-error with chosen fac-\\ntors of the financial data wherein the prediction performances were\\nevaluated using MAE, MAPE, and RMSE metrics. A higher prediction\\naccuracy could be observed due to GA-based enhanced sensitivity of\\nVMD towards the random financial fluctuations [79]. For complicated\\nor dynamic systems, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)\\nwas developed to link NN with fuzzy logic; taking this model into\\nconsideration, authors in Ref. [80] proposed to use GA for parameter\\noptimization of ANFIS and used the same for stock index predic-\\ntion. The proposed GA-ANFIS enhanced the prediction performance as\\ncompared to ANFIS without parameter optimization. Recently, double\\nchains quantum GA was proposed to tune learning rates and the\\noptimized parameters were utilized for stock price prediction in [81];\\nthe proposed approach worked with quantum Elman neural network\\n(QENN) model that combined the advantages of machine learning and\\nGA. With the improved results, the authors demonstrated usefulness of\\ninternal self-connection signal.\\n3.3. Stock Trend Prediction\\nThe stock price movement, also called stock trend, can be an im-\\nportant aspect in identifying if the market would be going upward or\\ndownward. The trend can be determined using various information and\\nmarket analyses; as compared to stock price prediction, trend forecast-\\ning can be more convenient in making trading decisions wherein the\\nbasic concern is likely to be on the market trend instead of the exact\\namount. Such tradings are likely to take place based on the buy, sell,\\nor hold decisions. Hence, optimization of model parameters using GAs,\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n11\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nas well as other methods, can be an important aspect in determining\\nthe future market trend.\\nBased on the wavelet theory, a feed-forward network, namely\\nwavelet neural network (WNN) was developed. It could benefit with\\nautomatically separating data components of a time-series [82]. Consid-\\nering such WNN as a stock market prediction model, authors proposed\\nto derive the optimal parameter weights using GA in [83]. Because\\nof the ability to hold structural changes at higher order, the Morlet\\nwavelet was selected for deriving buy, sell, or hold decisions based on\\nthe movement direction of the success rate.\\nThrough extended training time, a large number of parameters,\\nand convergence to local optimum solutions are some of the ma-\\njor limitations of ANNs with BP, this may worsen in the case of\\noperating long-term dependencies of stock market-based time-series\\ndata. Because gradient search-based NNs could not perform efficiently\\nfor non-linear optimization problems, a GA-based ANN approach was\\nconsidered for next day stock price movement prediction in [84].\\nAuthors modelled ANN with single input, hidden, and output layers\\nwhere each chromosome was represented as a string of weights and\\nbiases; new populations were created using GA based on the fitness\\nevaluation. Other advances include ANN weight optimization using\\nbinarized GA (BGANN) [85] for creating decision-making rules; such\\nrules can provide reference to the investors.\\nForecasting stock price has not been limited to historical price data;\\nresearchers have started exploiting various news sites as well as social\\nmedia for stock market prediction. Clustering techniques may also be\\nsuitable to analyse such unlabelled data. Social media messages were\\ncollected and represented using vector representation model (VRM)\\nin [86]; initial centroids of k-means clustering were selected for three\\ndecision classes and GA was applied to optimize the clustering algo-\\nrithm as an extension of the previous work in [87]. On the other hand,\\nthe temporal properties of stock market were explored to determine\\ntime window size and LSTM network using GA [88]. Subsequently, a\\ngeneralized model was proposed using support vector machine (SVM)\\nand GA for next-day stock trend prediction [89]; GA was adopted\\nto find an optimal time window for each technical indicator. Subse-\\nquently, the data error penalty coefficient and kernel function of SVM\\ndot kernel that could influence the predictability were optimized using\\nGA in [90]; performance analysis indicated improved prediction accu-\\nracy than PSO-based SVM as well as higher profit returns as compared\\nto individual technical indicators. One of the recent advances predicted\\nstock market along with N-day ahead stock prediction using a hybrid\\nANN with GA [91].\\n3.4. An Experimental Analysis\\nThe significance of parameter optimization can be viewed with\\na perspective of experimental evaluation. For this purpose, a sam-\\nple dataset Hyundai Motor Co. (005380.KS) [88] is considered with\\ndata collected between 01-01-2000 and 31-12-2016; Open, High, Low,\\nClose, Volume, simple moving average (SMA), weighted moving aver-\\nage (WMA), relative strength index (RSI), Stochastic %K, and Stochastic\\n%D features are adopted [88]. With 70 population size, single-point\\ncrossover with 0.7 rate, and bit-flip mutation with 0.15 rate, MSE\\nfitness function is considered for the experimentation [88]. Here, an\\nLSTM model is adopted with 10 −𝑛ℎ1 −𝑛ℎ2 −1 architecture and 𝑛𝑤\\nwindow size such that 𝑛ℎ1 and 𝑛ℎ2 indicate the number of nodes in\\nhidden layers 1 and 2, respectively; the aim is to optimize 𝑛𝑤, 𝑛ℎ1,\\nand 𝑛ℎ2 using GA and compare the same with other metaheuristics\\nfor a fair comparison. Thus, each chromosome represents these pa-\\nrameters in their binary format. With the considered LSTM mode,\\n𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎand linear activation functions and Adam optimizer are adopted\\nas described in [88]. While stock price prediction is evaluated using\\nMSE, the trend deterministic R2 score metric is adopted for stock\\ntrend prediction. Comparison of GA with DE, PSO, and ALO for pa-\\nrameter optimization-based stock price and stock trend prediction are\\ndemonstrated in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively.\\nWhile GA performs better than DE in terms of MSE as well as R2\\nscore, the swarm intelligence-based PSO and ALO have better pre-\\ndiction performances. While parameter optimization has been an im-\\nportant factor, such demonstrations can be useful in identifying the\\nsignificance of the selected metaheuristics and how the same can be\\nutilized to overcome limitations of the other approaches.\\n3.5. Summary\\nParameters of a given model can have a significant impact on the\\nmodel’s performance. While manual selection or greedy approach may\\nnot be suitable in order to tune such parameters, various optimization\\nalgorithms can be adapted for solving the parameter optimization prob-\\nlem. The financial market applications are challenging due to a large\\nnumber of uncertainties associated with such markets; also, the poten-\\ntial influences can introduce fluctuations in the market behaviours. In\\norder to deal with such situations, it is important to develop prediction\\nmodels that can serve robust solutions; such solutions can highly be\\ndependent on the selection of model’s hyperparameters. Among the\\nseveral hyperparameter tuning approaches, GA can be utilized due to\\nits ability to search for near-optimal solutions from a large search space.\\nThis section provides an illustrative representation on how GAs can be\\nadapted for parameter optimization; the applications of GAs for the\\nstock price, as well as stock trend, prediction are reviewed with the\\nrecent advances in the literature. A summary of the reviewed articles\\non GA-based parameter optimization for stock price prediction and\\nstock trend prediction is given in Table 2. Here, specifications on the\\nconsidered GA operations and representations are provided along with\\nthe stock market forecastings and corresponding results.\\n4. Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection\\nGAs offer a way in which chromosome strings can be presented to\\nindicate specific aspects. One of the important factors of a prediction\\nmodel is the input features [95]; while these features can be manually\\nselected, it is essential to understand the impact of such features on the\\nprediction model and its overall performance. Therefore, GAs can be\\nadopted for feature selection; it can be a useful approach in automati-\\ncally deriving important features from the available pool of features and\\nother properties. In this section, we demonstrate how GA chromosomes\\ncan be utilized to indicate which features can be chosen; we further\\nreview the applications of GA-based feature selection approaches in\\nstock price prediction and stock trend prediction.\\n4.1. Overview\\nFeatures play a vital role in the model’s learning phase; useful\\ninformation can be derived from features and hence, it is a critical task\\nto select a set of meaningful features. In stock market, various technical\\nindicators can be derived from the available stock data to understand\\nthe market characteristics; also, several related data can be appended\\nwith the existing properties to assist the market analysis. Identification\\nof such features can be helpful for stock market prediction. Among the\\nwidely available list of possible features, manual analysis and selection\\nof features may be a challenging approach; there have been various\\nmethods proposed for feature selection that can be broadly applied\\nbased on the type of data and other available information. Some of\\nthe main reasons why feature selection is essential can be understood\\nwith the concepts of redundancy and dimensionality. It may be possible\\nthat the set of features would be having two or more features that\\nare redundant to each other and hence, they do not add any new\\ninformation; such features would result in increasing the size of the\\nfeature set which, in turn, increases the dimensionality of operable\\ndata and complexity of the model. Therefore, the redundant features\\nshould be eliminated and the dimensionality should be reduced in\\norder to have a concise set of features. Also, features that do not\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n12\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nFig. 10.

An illustrative representation of binary-encoded feature sets after genetic algorithm operations.\\nprovide much information can be eliminated from the consideration.\\nInstead of a manual selection, various computational approaches should\\nbe integrated to deal with feature selection; these approaches may\\ncalculate the correlation among features, importance of features, or\\nother information and a set of features can be obtained. GA is one of\\nthe metaheuristics that can be applied for feature selection.\\nIn continuation to the previously presented GA operation illustra-\\ntions, we demonstrate one of the ways in which feature selection can\\nbe carried out using GA in Figs. 12 and 13. Here, we consider an initial\\nset of 12 features, represented with F0, F1, ..., F11. Each binary-encoded\\nchromosome denotes whether the specific feature is selected; for exam-\\nple, Chromosome 1 in Fig. 12 shows 0s for features F0, F3, and F7 which\\nmeans these features are to be eliminated from consideration, whereas\\n1s for the remaining features indicate the inclusion of these features;\\nthe selected set of features for each chromosome is also presented\\nfor a clear understanding. These chromosomes undergo crossover and\\nmutation operations as given by Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. At this\\nstage, a new set of features can be observed in Fig. 13 such that\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n13\\nA. Thakkar and K.

Such changes\\ncan be observed with other offsprings; the same can be evaluated\\nagainst the considered fitness function and the fittest solutions can be\\nderived for further generations. Thus, GA can be integrated for feature\\nselection. Among various potential applications, financial market fore-\\ncasting considerably requires identification of a set of useful features;\\nsuch features can be historical stock market data, derived technical\\nindicators, associated stock information, as well as fused features. In\\norder to have an efficient selection of features, several approaches have\\nadopted GAs because of their ability to obtain potential solutions from\\nthe large search spaces.\\n4.2. Stock Price Prediction\\nThe identification of useful features is an essential part for reliable\\nprediction. The stock price prediction can be significantly affected\\nby the set of features adopted during the model’s learning phase.\\nTherefore, it is important to utilize the market information and select\\na set of features that hold informative details; such features can be\\neffectively selected using GAs.\\nFor stock close price prediction, GA and rough set (RS) theory were\\nutilized along with fuzzy time-series model in [96]. GA was exploited\\nto derive the universe of discourse and partition interval length based\\non the observed characteristics of stock trend; fuzzy logic rules and\\ncorresponding weights were generated for the fuzzified observations\\nusing RS. Authors applied defuzzification to derive the predicted stock\\nindex price. Experiment on Nikkei Index data for the year 2014 indi-\\ncated higher prediction accuracy of the proposed approach than that\\nof fuzzy time-series without GA and RS.\\nThe applicability of LSTM models is well-known for the time-series\\nstock market predictions; one of the recent advances proposed to\\nintegrate GA for selecting a set of features and used the same with LSTM\\nfor stock price prediction [97]. Authors considered a set of 40 factors,\\ni.e., features, and applied GA to determine the importance ranking of\\nthese factors; subsets of top 30, 20, 10, and 5 factors influencing the\\nstock price were further selected and provided as input features to\\nthe LSTM model. The performance improvement and robustness of the\\nproposed approach were shown using MSE metric [97].\\n4.3. Stock Trend Prediction\\nThe stock movement direction can be categorized using the index\\nvalues. Instead of predicting the exact price value, price hike or drop\\nmovement can be determined for a short-term, as well as long-term,\\nperiod; this can also be helpful in deriving trading rules. GA-based ap-\\nproaches have been integrated for feature selection to predict the stock\\ntrend; such features are desired to study the inherent characteristics of\\nstock market movements. The effective problem-solving ability of GA\\ncan be exploited to find a reliable set of features that can be given as\\ninput to the prediction model.\\nWhile a large number of technical indicators exist, a GA-based\\nthree-layered feed-forward ANN approach was proposed to prepare a\\nset of diverse features in [98]. Authors collected daily close price of\\nstock exchange of Thailand (SET50) and experimented with technical\\nindicators of varying time span lengths to predict stock price index\\ntrend; an average improvement of 12.4% was achieved as compared\\nto the previous work with ANN [99].\\nOn the other hand, individuals having financial background are\\nlikely to adopt fundamental analysis whereas others may opt for techni-\\ncal methods such as filtration for feature selection. A wrapper method\\nwas selected for extracting useful features along with an extended GA\\nin [100]. Authors experimented with CSI 300 daily stock data and\\nclassified stock trend using SVM. The capabilities of GA in selecting\\na set of features were explored along with SVM kernel parameters\\nin Ref. [101]. Authors integrated GA and SVM to develop a homo-\\ngeneous ensemble classifier namely, GASVM, to predict 10-day ahead\\nstock trend. The comparison of the proposed GASVM with the existing\\ndecision tree (DT), NN, RF, and (ensembled) 15 SVM (ESVM) based on\\n14 features derived from Ghana stock exchange (GSE); the results in-\\ndicated considerably higher prediction performance with the proposed\\nGASVM [101].\\nThe trading rules have been referred to by a large number of\\nindividuals, however, optimization of such rules can be a challeng-\\ning task. In order to build such trading strategies using trading rule\\nfeatures, a RoboTrading system was proposed with GA maximizing\\nsharpe and sterling ratio (GA-MSSR) method [102]. Authors proposed\\nto use SSR, i.e., sharpe and sterling ratio, to derive risk-adjusted re-\\nturn; the proposed approach integrated GA with the consideration that\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n15\\nA.

The results indicated that the features\\nderived using the trading rules could provide information on evaluating\\nthe price movement trend over a long period of time; the proposed\\nformulation of trading strategies optimize the performance [102]. Re-\\ncently, the concept of distributed lag analysis was considered in [103]\\nand GA was adopted to select a set of useful features for stock trend\\nprediction using random forest (RF).\\n4.4. An Experimental Analysis\\nThe significance of parameter optimization can be viewed with a\\nperspective of experimental evaluation. For this purpose, as explained\\nearlier, dataset 005380.KS is considered with data collected between\\n01-01-2000 and 31-12-2016; Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, SMA,\\nWMA, RSI, Stochastic %K, and Stochastic %D features are adopted [88]\\nwith chromosomes representing these features. Here, the considered\\nLSTM model is adopted with 10 −15 −7 −1 architecture and 10\\nwindow size, 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎand linear activation functions and Adam optimizer\\nas described in [88]. While stock price prediction is evaluated using\\nMSE, the trend deterministic R2 score metric is adopted for stock trend\\nprediction. Comparison of GA with DE, PSO, and ALO for feature\\nselection-based stock price and stock trend prediction are demonstrated\\nin Figs. 14 and 15, respectively.\\nAs it can be seen, GA and DE perform quite similar whereas PSO\\nand ALO have comparatively better prediction performances. It can be\\nviewed as a potential expansion of considering the advances of other\\nswarm intelligence-based metaheuristics for integration with GA as well\\nas other evolutionary computation algorithms for an improved predic-\\ntion. Also, the significance of selecting features using such approaches\\ncan provide potential enhancement in the stock market forecasting.\\n4.5. Summary\\nApart from parameter optimization, the application of GAs for fea-\\nture selection or feature extraction can be applicable for stock market\\nforecasting. From a pool of available features representing specific\\naspects of the stock, it is a challenging task to select unique, infor-\\nmative features that can further aid the prediction model. This section\\nprovides an illustrative example on how GAs can be adapted for this\\ntask; the same is also supportive to financial markets. The reviewed\\narticles indicate the performance enhancements received due to GA-\\nbased feature selection approaches. A summary of the reviewed articles\\nwith a primary focus on GA-based feature selection for stock price, as\\nwell as stock trend, prediction is given in Table 3.\\n5. Genetic Algorithms for Other Stock Market Applications\\nThere have been a large number of possibilities in which various\\nperspectives can be demonstrated using GA chromosomes; the chro-\\nmosomes are a representative form of a group of genes such that\\nan individual gene can indicate a specific value. These values may\\nbelong to binary or continuous numbers; they may also be presented\\nwith trading rules. In case of having a portfolio optimization, such\\nchromosomes can operate on the percentage of selected stocks or their\\nweightage. Thus, the varieties offered by chromosomes can be potential\\nsolutions to several stock market applications.\\n5.1.

For recommending a\\nportfolio, GA properties may be utilized to optimize trading-based\\nparameters and/or strategy [104].\\nWhile suggesting a specific trading strategy may not interest all the\\ninvestors, recommending a group of trading strategies was proposed\\nin [105] to provide a variety of options to potential investors. The aim\\nof optimizing such a portfolio strategy was to maximize returns and\\nminimize risk based on the weights of individual groups. A grouping\\nGA (GGA) was adopted where chromosomes consisted of group, weight,\\nand technical indicators-based trading strategy; the fitness function\\nwas determined using portfolio return, associated risk, and balances\\nof group and weight. An experiment on stock data collected over\\nyears 2011 to 2016 indicated positive returns as well as risk-avoiding\\nability. Subsequently, GGA was implemented for group trading strategy\\nportfolio by representing chromosome as group, strategy, and weight\\nparts whereas the fitness value using balances of group as well as\\nweight, portfolio return, and risk factors in [106]. Another GGA-based\\napproach was proposed for diverse group stock portfolio optimization\\n(DGSPO) [107]; authors designed group diversity factor in order to\\nhave diversification of stocks from various industries and the same was\\nadopted as a fitness function.\\nBecause a group stock portfolio contains similar stocks in the same\\ngroup, investors can substitute stocks within the same group. Such\\ndynamic grouping was proposed using GGA with grouping, stock, and\\nportfolio were selected as part of chromosomes [108]. The groups were\\ncreated by considering stock price series and reducing the high dimen-\\nsionality using symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) and extended\\nSAX (ESAX). Also, a stability factor was developed using cash dividends\\nof stocks. Authors had selected modified portfolio satisfaction, group\\nbalance, and series distance as the first fitness function and along with\\nthat, price balance and unit balance as the second fitness function;\\nthey evaluated chromosome and individual quality, respectively. The\\nproposed approach improved return on investment (ROI) and group\\nsimilarity and the trade-off was found as well.\\nVarious approaches have used clustering techniques to group stock-\\nrelated information. In [109], authors developed various portfolios\\nwith cluster analysis of investor information; the investors belonged\\nto foreign, institutional, or individual types. For each type, weight\\noptimization was performed on the selected stocks using GA. Authors\\nexperimented with 90 companies having the highest market capital-\\nization from the Korea composite stock price index (KOSPI 200); high\\nreturns were achieved with this approach.\\nUsing support vector regression (SVR), decision-making day stock\\nclose price was predicted and portfolio was optimized using GA based\\non the investment profit and risk factors [110]. The trading data were\\nimplemented to calculate stock transactions and overall investment\\nprofit. On the other hand, an agglomerative clustering was adapted\\nwith GA to apply diversification-based portfolio optimization [111]; au-\\nthors considered cardinality, quantity, and transaction cost constraints\\nin a possibilistic mean-semi-absolute deviation portfolio optimization\\nmodel. Authors proposed to derive seven financial ratios of each asset\\nand prepared a feature vector to further identify linkages between data;\\nthe best cluster of assets was further identified using agglomerative\\nclustering whereas GA was used to determine the weights of the chosen\\nstocks using fitness as given by Eq. (6) [111].\\n𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠=\\n[ 𝜆\\n2\\n𝑛\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n[𝑏𝑖−𝑎𝑖+ 1\\n3 (𝛼𝑖+ 𝛽𝑖)]𝑤𝑖−(1 −𝜆)\\n{ 𝑛\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n1\\n2\\n[𝑎𝑖+ 𝑏𝑖+ 1\\n3 (𝛽𝑖−𝛼𝑖)]𝑤𝑖−\\n𝑛\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n𝑘𝑖‖𝑤𝑖−𝑤0\\n𝑖‖\\n} ]\\n(6)\\nwhere, the proportion invested in asset 𝑖on the existing portfolio was\\ngiven by 𝑤0\\n𝑖and by 𝑤𝑖for others; 𝑟𝑖denoted the return rate of asset\\n𝑖; 𝑘𝑖indicated the constant rate of transaction cost for risky asset 𝑖; 𝜆\\nspecified the investor risk tolerance such that 0 ≤𝜆≤1; 𝑛was the\\nnumber of assets.\\nA price-based portfolio selection approach was considered using\\nfuzzy stochastic price scenario [112]. For Bombay stock exchange (BSE)\\nstocks, ratio factors were evaluated which indicated future fuzzy prices\\nand returns were calculated. Authors included transaction cost with\\ncapital budget and applied fuzzy GA to attain long-term and short-\\nterm returns. On the other hand, an NN-based approach was proposed\\nto forecast stock returns and to measure the associated risk [113];\\nauthors utilized this approach to further optimize portfolios with low,\\nmedium, and high risks for risk-averse as well as risk-taker investors\\nusing GA. One of the recent approaches used priority index along\\nwith GA to optimize stock portfolios [114]; authors proposed to derive\\npriority index scores of the selected stocks and further, determined\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n17\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nthe percentage of investment to the selected stocks using GA. Also,\\na wealth creation parameter was considered to evaluate its role in\\nportfolio returns. A different length GA-based clustering approach was\\nproposed in Ref. [115] wherein vertical as well as horizontal clusterings\\nwere applied to generate a limited number of stocks. Authors clustered\\nstocks based on their returns per unit of risk for each day, i.e., through\\nvertical clustering, and clustered the algorithm centroids on a timely\\nmanner, i.e., through horizontal clustering. Also, the Markowitz model\\nwas integrated for weight identification of stocks belonging to the\\nportfolio; the results indicated higher performance using the proposed\\nGA-based clustering approach [115].\\nPortfolio profitability is one of the desirable aspects; to make a\\nprofitable decision, higher-order moments are taken into considera-\\ntion by many investors. Using the third and fourth order moments\\nin statistics, i.e., skewness and kurtosis, respectively, the portfolio\\nselection problem was addressed in study [116]; authors proposed\\nto include two-stage clustering, RBFNN, and GA for multi-objective\\noptimization, data-driven asset selection, and return prediction tasks.\\nThe results indicated enhanced performance using the proposed hybrid\\napproach as compared to the traditional mean–variance model [116].\\nOne of the recent approaches proposed sentiment all-weather (SAW)\\nand sentiment modern portfolio theory (SMPT) models in order to\\nobtain the market conditions using Twitter sentiments [117]; authors\\nused Google’s bidirectional transformer (BERT) model for this task.\\nUsing different objectives, GA was adopted to optimize the models\\nsuch that the cumulative returns, as well as sharpe ratio, could be\\nmaximized and volatility could be minimized. Authors also developed a\\nrobo-advisor based on the proposed models and portfolio management\\napproaches [117].\\n5.2. Stock Price and Trend Prediction\\nIt can be observed that a large number of GA applications belong\\nto the optimization of hyperparameters of various prediction models.\\nThe significance of such tuning can be noticed from the prediction\\nresults; while a considerable amount of performance improvement has\\nbeen attained, the same can be further supported by selecting and/or\\nextracting useful features. These features may be based on fundamental\\nanalysis as well as technical analysis. On the other hand, trading rules\\nplay a vital role in determining what actions can be taken with the\\ntargeted stock; such rules can be derived along with other hybrid\\napplications using GAs. This section conducts a review on other such\\napplications of GAs for stock price, as well as trend, forecasting.\\nIn stock markets, different trading strategies are followed by various\\ninvesting parties. The expectation is to gain higher profits and hence,\\ntraders may look forward to the financial behaviours, economic charac-\\nteristics, associated news and events, as well as various public opinions.\\nSuch factors can be helpful in developing various trading rules. For\\nthe crude oil futures market, authors proposed to develop trading rules\\nbased on moving average (MA) indicators [118]. For this purpose, SMA,\\nweighted MA (WMA), exponential MA (EMA), adaptive MA (AMA),\\ntypical price MA (TPMA), and triangular MA (TMA) were considered.\\nThe trading rules defined short and long periods wherein the fitness of\\nthese rules were evaluated using excess return rate as given by Eq. (7);\\nGA-based new trading rules were generated for the given period.\\n𝑅𝑎= 𝑅𝑎𝑙+ 𝑅𝑎𝑠+ 𝑅𝑓−𝑅𝑏ℎ\\n(7)\\nwhere, 𝑅𝑎𝑙and 𝑅𝑎𝑠represented returns of long position and short po-\\nsition respectively; 𝑅𝑓indicated risk free return whereas 𝑅𝑏ℎspecified\\nreturn rate of the buy-and-hold strategy which took the long position\\nthroughout the period [118].\\nGAs are capable of searching through large search spaces, however,\\npotential limitations such as being trapped into local optima may be\\nsolved by integrating other metaheuristic approaches. Such an ensem-\\nbled version can be useful in improving the prediction models. The\\nstock markets represent diverse characteristics; hence, the selection of\\na single algorithm may not suffice. To address this issue, a cooperative\\noptimization framework was developed with GA and chemical reac-\\ntion optimization (CRO) in [119]. Author proposed to apply GA and\\nCRO as constituent algorithms and optimized the weights of an MLP\\nmodel; the information of the generated solutions was shared, i.e., mi-\\ngrated between the algorithms and the best solution was adopted. The\\nproposed framework demonstrated performance improvement using\\naverage percentage of errors (APE) metric as given by Eq. (8).\\n𝐴𝑃𝐸= 1\\n𝑁\\n𝑁\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n|𝑦𝑖−̂𝑦𝑖|\\n𝑦𝑖\\n× 100\\n(8)\\nwhere, 𝑦𝑖and ̂𝑦𝑖indicated the actual value and output value of the 𝑖th\\ndata, respectively; 𝑁represented the total number of data.\\nFor complex stock market data, SVM can provide linear model map-\\nping for high-dimensional non-linear data. This can be useful to create\\nhyperplane(s) for providing distinction among the classes. Hence, a GA-\\nensembled SVM method was proposed in [120] with the Gaussian RBF\\nas the kernel. Authors predicted the trend of one-week-ahead stock\\nprice of the Bovespa index of Brazilian stock exchange. To enhance\\nthe performance accuracy, other stock indices such as S&P 500, Dow\\nJones industrial average, FTSE 100, DAX, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng\\nwere examined along with USD, Euro (EUR), and Chinese Yuan (CNY)\\ncurrencies; the proposed approach outperformed Bagging, AdaBoost,\\nRF, and SVM with RBF kernel.\\nSuch stock tradings are likely to be dependent on the predicted price\\nmovements. The future direction can be derived using association rule\\nmining; however, such classification may encounter issues in handling\\nnumerical data and internal relations. To address these limitations,\\nrelation representation models may be constructed. Hence, a GA-based\\napproach was proposed to construct optimized relations among tech-\\nnical indicators in [121]; association rules were generated to classify\\nthe stock price change into positive, negative, or no change based on\\nthe difference between close price of a trading day and next day’s open\\nprice.\\nSubsequently, an intelligent hybrid trading system using RSs and\\nGA was proposed in [122]. The conditional attributes and decision\\nattributes, i.e., up or down, were generated using RS analysis. To ensure\\nthat GA could efficiently work with high-dimensional stock data and to\\nreduce the search space, reduction techniques were performed with RSs\\nand optimal as well as sub-optimal trading rules were discovered. The\\ndegree of applicability of such a system was experimented with KOSPI\\n200 dataset; training with six-month period and 50 decision rule sets\\ncould deliver the highest annualized return rate. With an increasing\\ndemand of algorithmic trading, it is important to understand how\\nGA as well as other evolutionary algorithms can enhance the trading\\nstrategies; an approach was proposed by combining two GAs to find the\\nbest optimization and trading window for a trading strategy in [123].\\nA recent approach proposed information fusion-based GA approach\\nfor stock price and trend prediction [124]. With a motivation to inte-\\ngrate genetic diversity and survival capabilities of various organisms,\\nauthors proposed GA with inter-intra crossover and adaptive mutation\\n(ICAN) to optimize parameters of an LSTM prediction model and select\\na set of features. The prediction performance of GA with ICAN indi-\\ncated remarkable improvement using MSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2 score\\nmetrics.\\n5.3. Summary\\nApart from the specific applications of GAs such as hyperparameter\\ntuning and feature selection, this section precisely concentrates on the\\nother potential ways in which GAs are integrated with financial market\\nforecasting. These applications include the usability of chromosomes\\nfor a variety of representations such as portfolio, stocks, groups, trading\\nrules, percentage of stock information, to name a few. The adaptability\\nof GAs with other approaches can also be viewed from their potential\\napplicability to various stock market predictions, as well as portfolio\\noptimization, problems.

Other Genetic Perspectives for Stock Market Applications\\nThe genetic processes have evolved to provide solutions to unstruc-\\ntured and complex problems. Along with GAs, other genetic perspec-\\ntives have also been considered to provide a potential environment for\\nstock market prediction. This section briefly considers such implica-\\ntions and reviews existing work for financial market forecasting. It also\\nanalyzes the rationale for applying genetic perspectives to stock market\\nprediction (RQ1).\\n6.1. Genetic Programming\\nGenetic programming (GP) can be considered as an implication of\\nGA to a computer program population; while GA optimizes a linear\\nrepresentation of the fixed-length, GP can operate tree representation\\nof a variable size [11]. Similar to GA, the operations involved in GP\\ninclude selection, crossover, and mutation; traditional representation\\nof parse tree structures can be evaluated recursively [11,126,127]. The\\nfitness function represents the cost function that may be defined based\\non the desired output; it evaluates the score derived using the parse\\ntree. The randomly created initial populations have random parameter\\nspecifications and further child structures; while full method contains\\nequal lengths from the root to a leaf, grow method may not satisfy\\nthis criterion. Based on the fitness value, individuals are selected for\\nreproduction. Similar to that in GA, a crossover rate is decided for\\ncreating the next generation and new structures may be introduced\\nwith mutation applied to a small part of the population.\\nTo derive an optimal representation of GP, many variants have\\nalso been introduced. The state space size and multi-dimensional type\\nconstraints may be considered as some of the primary limitations of\\nGP; a strongly typed GP (STGP) was proposed as a type constraint\\nvariation of GP [128] where the root node returned the type of the\\nactual problem definition whereas each non-root node returned the\\ntype required by its parent node. Other constraining structures such as\\nenforcing specific structure, grammar-based constraints, and bias have\\nalso been developed [24]. Subsequently, the graphical representations\\nof trees introduced graph-based GP which were extended for the paral-\\nlel distributed GP (PDGP) for highly parallel programs [129]. Due to the\\nbasic linear representations of computer programs and the requirement\\nof tree-based compilers and/or interpreters motivated developing a\\nlinear GP (LGP) of fixed as well as variable length trees [130]. The\\ndirected acyclic graph representation of a program was introduced us-\\ning Cartesian GP (CGP) [131]; the genes associated with CGP genotype\\nspecify information regarding data and operations of nodes. The fixed-\\nlength genotypes may have variable-length programs, also known as\\nphenotypes and the mappings among them define CGP characteristics;\\na function look-up table plays an important role for gene compu-\\ntations. Other variations of GP involve probabilistic GP, mixture of\\ngrammars and probabilities, multi-objective GP (MOGP), grammatical\\nevolution [24], to name a few. The selection of an appropriate GP vari-\\nant would be dependent on the target application and the prediction\\nmodels associated with it.\\nOne of the major advantages of GP structures is that they do not\\ncreate invalid states in a majority of the cases [132,133]; the inherent\\nvariable length demonstrates flexibility for complex, non-linear data\\nsuch as financial market. Also, the limitations such as dealing with\\ndifferent data types or constraints can be addressed using different tree\\nstructures of GP variants itself [134,135]. Hence, GP-based approaches\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n20\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nhave been adopted for pattern identification, risk assessment, forecast-\\ning stock market using various trading rules, and optimization. It uses\\nan artificial evolution within a system for developing a computational\\nprogram automatically. Such an approach can be largely applied to\\nvarious fields including financial markets [134,135]. Stock market\\nindex movement and corresponding portfolio selection are some of the\\npotential applications; trading rule generation, parameter optimization,\\nand regression-based techniques can be enhanced with GP.\\n6.2. Gene Expression Programming\\nOne of the limitations of GP such as handling constraint-based\\nrelation with different data types whereas the inability of GA to guar-\\nantee optimality require integration and extension of these genetic\\nperspectives to develop stable optimization approaches. Gene expres-\\nsion programming (GEP) is developed to incorporate fixed-length linear\\nchromosomes as that in GA and branched tree structures with varying\\nsizes and shapes as that in GP [27]. To predict short-to-medium term\\nfluctuations in the stock market, a parameter tuning method using GP\\nand GEP was proposed in [136]; authors proposed fractional adaptive\\nmutation rate (GEP-FAMR) Elitism to balance between mutation rate\\nand chromosome fitness and hence, improving overall prediction ac-\\ncuracy. Subsequently, a mutual funds-based investment strategy was\\nguided using trading rules generated with GEP [137]; the proposed\\napproach combined single asset time-series as well as portfolio man-\\nagement to generate trading rules which were suitable for a dynamic\\nmarket.\\n6.3. Genetic Network Programming\\nA string structure of GA and a tree representation of GP, i.e., a\\ngenome, can be considered as the foremost difference between GA and\\nGP [11]; similarly, genetic network programming (GNP) can be differ-\\nentiated based on the network-like genome structure. It was proposed\\nas a new evolutionary computation method to overcome the efficiency\\nissue of GP [29]. It consists of judgement and processing nodes that\\ncorrespond to terminal nodes and that in GP, respectively; GNP also\\nconsists of mutation and crossover operators. The trading signals can\\nbe helpful to indicate whether specific stocks should be bought, sold,\\nor not traded; such an approach was developed using fuzzy GNP with\\nreinforcement learning (RL) [138]. A recent study proposed GNP-based\\napproach with weighted inter-section class association rule mining for\\nstock market prediction [139].\\nOther variations such as neuro-genetics, genetic engineering, and\\nhybrid methods can be applied for specific tasks in stock market\\nprediction.\\n7. Competitiveness and Complementation of Genetic Algorithms\\nIn the current literature studies, various metaheuristic methods are\\napplied to solve stock market-related prediction problems. While our\\nprimary review is based on the adaptability of GAs for stock price\\nand stock trend prediction, it is worth mentioning how other swarm\\nand evolutionary computation approaches are used to compete or even\\nimprove the results achieved using GAs. In order to provide a balanced\\nsurvey, we discuss the participation of other methods and compare\\nthem with GAs; we also discuss how GAs complement other algorithms\\nto improve the prediction models. Such analysis may be useful in\\ndeveloping fusion-based approaches to derive concrete stock market\\nprediction methods.\\n7.1. Other Metaheuristics vs. Genetic Algorithms\\nWhile a significant amount of stock market prediction work has\\nbeen carried out using GAs, other swarm and evolutionary approaches\\nhave demonstrated performance improvement as compared to GAs.\\nThis section briefly addresses RQ4 to determine the competitiveness of\\nGAs with respect to other metaheuristics for stock market prediction.\\n7.1.1. Particle Swarm Optimization\\nA large number of nature-inspired optimization approaches have\\nbeen developed and explored for stock market forecasting; particle\\nswarm optimization (PSO) is one of such metaheuristics which was in-\\nspired by the swarm intelligence of bird flocks searching for corn. PSO\\npresents the social movement of the particles associated with a swarm\\nthat move towards a global best position in the search space [140].\\nOne of the primary reasons for adapting PSO for time-series data is its\\ncapability to deal with continuous data [141].\\nPSO is integrated with various methods to improve its forecasting\\nabilities for non-linear stock markets. Based on the principle of centre\\nof mass, PSOCoM was proposed to support the cognitive behaviour of\\nthe particles [142]. The long-term, as well as short-term predictions,\\nwere carried out using this approach; comparisons using mean squared\\nerror (MSE) indicated faster convergence of PSOCoM than that of GA.\\nOne of the ANN-based hybrid approaches, an improved cuckoo search\\nGA (ICSGA), was proposed in [143] for stock price prediction. Though\\nPSO derived the most accurate predictions, the proposed ICSGA could\\nalso improve the performance as compared to CS, ICS, as well as GA.\\nAnother approach based on hyperparameter tuning using grid\\nsearch approach, GA, as well as PSO, was proposed for an SVM\\nmodel in Ref. [144]; authors proposed to optimize parameters of\\nvarious kernel functions using these three methods and evaluated stock\\nprice prediction. The results indicated higher performances attained\\nby GA as compared to PSO and grid search methods; a remarkable\\nperformance enhancement was attained for radial basis kernel func-\\ntion using GA-optimized SVM parameters [144]. One of the recent\\nadvances integrated MLP-GA and MLP-PSO for Borsa Istanbul (BIST)\\n100 index movement prediction [145]; the results indicated close re-\\nsults with MLP-PSO having slightly higher performance than MLP-GA,\\nhowever, both the approaches attained close results on the prediction\\nperformances for Gaussian function as well as 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑥) [145].\\n7.1.2. Ant Colony Optimization\\nInspired by the behaviours of real-ants, an ant colony optimization\\n(ACO) approach was developed with artificial ants. The pheromone\\ntrails provided by such ants were developed to further optimize the\\ngiven search space [146]. Several variations of ACO have also been\\nintroduced to find potential global solutions. Considering financial\\nmarkets, such an optimization approach can be helpful in deriving an\\noptimal set of features, model parameters, etc.\\nFor the financial crisis prediction, an ACO-based feature selection\\n(ACO-FS) and ACO-based data classification (ACO-DC) methods were\\nproposed [9]. Further, authors proposed to compare feature selection\\nperformance of ACO-FS with feature selection based on GA, PSO,\\nand grey wolf optimization (GWO) methods; among these methods,\\nGA-based feature selection required the highest cost whereas the pro-\\nposed ACO-FS resulted in the minimum cost. On the other hand,\\nperformances of various classifiers were evaluated for these feature\\nselection methods wherein the ACO-based financial crisis prediction\\nmodel outperformed [9].\\n7.1.3. Harmony Search\\nHarmony search (HS) is a music-based metaheuristic approach with\\nthe aim to search for a state of harmony [147]. Such optimality can be\\nincorporated for an optimization problem. It is also referred similar to\\nthe choice of best-fit individuals in GA [148].\\nWhile ANNs have been largely applied for stock market prediction,\\nvarious optimization techniques can be included to support the feature\\nselection process and hence, performance improvement. One of such\\napproaches was proposed in [149] where authors proposed to select\\na set of features from the given list of technical indicators using HS\\nand GA. The selected features using HS and GA were individually\\nprovided to ANN to predict stock price using HS-ANN and GA-ANN,\\nrespectively. The comparison indicated smaller MAPE using HS-ANN\\nas compared GA-ANN; the proposed hybrid models could attain higher\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n21\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nperformance as compared to individual ANN. Subsequently, HS was\\nproposed for ANN training phase in [150] to predict the stock price\\nof various companies; the optimization performance was compared by\\nincorporating ANN with imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), GA,\\nand PSO algorithms. The results indicated performance improvement\\nusing ANN-HS model. A cuckoo search (CS) and self-adaptive HS\\n(SAHS)-based model was proposed in [151] to optimize the weight of\\norders for stock index. Authors compared the results with traditional\\nHS, GA, SAHS, and cat swarm optimization (CSO) wherein the proposed\\nSAHS indicated higher fitness than others.\\n7.1.4. Butterfly Optimization Algorithm\\nThe food searching and mating behaviours of butterflies based on\\ntheir fragrance intensity were considered as a motivation to develop\\nbutterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) for global optimization [152].\\nFor an optimal parameter tuning of an SVR, BOA-SVR was proposed\\nin [153] for stock market prediction using daily close price. Comparison\\nwith SVR parameters optimization using various metaheuristics showed\\nthat BOA-SVR achieved higher accuracy as compared to GA-SVR; how-\\never, it must be noted that the computational expensiveness of GA-SVR\\nwas less as compared to BOA-SVR.\\n7.2. Hybridization with Genetic Algorithms\\nTo overcome the limitations of one approach, one or more com-\\nplementing methods can be hybridized to attain higher performance\\naccuracy. GAs have also been integrated for such hybrid approaches\\nalong with other metaheuristics for stock price as well as stock trend\\nprediction. Thus, this section addresses RQ3 and reviews the poten-\\ntial ways in which the performances of GAs have been enhanced by\\nhybridization with other approaches for stock market prediction.\\nBased on the existing ensemble models, it was argued that the linear\\nweighted approach might not be suitable for stock prices-based non-\\nlinear time-series data. For a stock e-exchange price prediction, Elman\\nnetwork, gated recurrent NN (GRNN), and WNN with SVM NN were\\nconsidered in [154]; authors optimized the model parameters with\\nimproved PSO (IPSO) using decimal and binary PSOs, i.e., DePSO and\\nBiPSO. For IPSO, GA-based crossover and mutation operations were\\nintroduced for particles’ performance enhancement. Hence, the training\\nspeed of PSO and global search capability of GA were integrated and\\nthe proposed approach, ANNs-PSO-GA, significantly improved stock\\nindices forecasting with high volatility and noise. The parameter op-\\ntimization capabilities of GA were also demonstrated with SVR for\\nshort-term trend prediction of a stock open price in [155]; the GA-\\nSVR calibration model provided an accurate prediction as compared to\\ngrid search-based GRID-SVR and PSO-SVR. A regression-based model,\\nauto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) was appointed for\\npredicting stock price in [156]; the forecasting approach was enhanced\\nusing the important regressors derived using GA. Similarly, a hybrid\\nNN with PSO and GA was proposed for predicting the market clearing\\nprice on an hourly basis [157]. Considering the higher time duration\\nrequirement for execution using GA, authors proposed to integrate an\\nexploitation-based algorithm to improve the optimization efficiency\\nof GA [158]; thus, the exchange market algorithm (EMA) was com-\\nbined with GA as EMGA to enhance the search strategy for stock\\nmarket optimization problems. Authors considered the balanced and\\nfluctuating conditions of stock markets and optimized the stocks for\\nstockholders. The results indicated effective optimization capabilities\\nusing EMGA [158]. Another important aspect in stock market is op-\\ntimization of index funds; for a subset of stocks, an index tracking\\nportfolio aims to match the performance of the benchmark index [159].\\nFor this purpose, a hybrid model based on GA and mixed-integer\\nnonlinear programming (MINLP) was proposed in study [159]. Authors\\nintegrated GA for selecting stocks that could be considered for index\\ntracking portfolio and adopted MINLP for estimating the weights of\\nsuch stocks; results showed the ability of the proposed approach in\\ncreating an index fund with a close return rate as that of the market\\nwith considerably lower risk [159].\\nThe primary focus of our survey is on stock price and stock trend\\nprediction along with portfolio optimization. Therefore, the competing\\nand complementing approaches discussed in this section are mainly as-\\nsociated with these applications of stock markets; interested researchers\\nmay be directed to explore further information on diverse financial\\napplications and the suitability of various metaheuristics.\\n8. Discussions\\nIn this article, we have reviewed the recent advances for stock mar-\\nket prediction based on variations and extensions of genetic perspec-\\ntives. An overview of linking genetic perspectives with stock market\\nprediction is given in Fig. 16. A graphical representation of our survey\\npresents various genetic perspectives and other algorithms that are hy-\\nbridized with such approaches for stock market prediction applications.\\nIt also provides a list of potential stock market applications. Though\\nwe have primarily considered stock price and stock trend forecasting\\ntechniques using GAs, such approaches can also be integrated for\\nother finance-based applications such as portfolio optimization [46],\\nmarket volatility prediction [160], trading strategy [34], bankruptcy\\nprediction [44,161], foreign exchange tradings [162,163].\\nHere, several experimental analyses have been carried out to\\ndemonstrate how GA-based parameter optimization as well as feature\\nselection approaches may result for stock price and trend prediction. As\\nit can be seen through Figs. 10, 11, 14, and 15, GA and DE approaches\\nhave near-similar prediction performances; as they both belong to\\nevolutionary computation, their approach to solve the given problem\\nthrough evolution can be viewed to have considerable prediction\\nresults. On the other hand, two swarm intelligence-based algorithms,\\ni.e., PSO and ALO have also been experimented and compared with GA\\nand DE; while these methods have reduced errors even further, their\\nimplications to stock market prediction can be viewed for potential\\nexpansion. While the comparisons have been carried out for a sample\\ndataset with primary set of features as well as model, an existing\\narticle has proposed information fusion-based approach with inter-intra\\ncrossover as well as adaptive mutation operations [124] wherein single\\nchromosome contains two parts to focus on parameter optimization as\\nwell as feature selection problems together. As given in this article, the\\ndataset considered here for the experiment has showcased an improved\\nperformance as compared to ALO; this indicates that the superiority of\\nGA can be demonstrated through fusion. Through the detailed analysis\\nof various aspects, it can be understood that prediction performance\\ncan be largely dependent on the dataset considered, features, pre-\\nprocessing techniques, selection of prediction model as well as its\\nhyperparameters, optimization algorithm, tuning of parameters, the\\ntarget application, to name a few. As the experimental environment\\nconstraints may change, it is likely to observe variation in the forecast-\\ning results. Also, the computational complexity can play a vital role\\nin identifying an appropriate choice of experimental set-up. According\\nto the No Free Lunch theorem, the average performance of all such\\noptimization algorithms is likely to be equal [164,165] and hence, it is\\nof an utmost importance to determine the essential matters associated\\nwith the problem of interest and to determine the superior optimization\\nalgorithm to obtain desirable forecasting results. It can be observed\\nthat various genetics-based methods have been hybridized with other\\nalgorithms to build optimal models; such models have been utilized\\nfor stock market prediction applications. Though a significant amount\\nof work has been carried out using such evolutionary algorithms, the\\nexisting challenges, as well as potential future research directions in\\nthe field of GA-based stock market prediction, are worth mentioning.\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n22\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\nFig. 16. An overview of linking genetic perspectives with stock market prediction.\\n8.1. Challenges\\nGA has been developed as a natural selection-based optimization\\napproach; although it has the ability to search through large solution\\nspaces, it may not guarantee to find an optimal solution [166]. On the\\nother hand, it may require a longer duration to converge as well as it\\nmay get trapped into local optima.\\nTo develop a GA-based approach, various parameters need to be\\ndefined and represented for the given problem. This process requires\\nidentification of appropriate population size, fitness function, selection\\nstrategy, crossover and mutation rates. Also, defining stopping criteria\\nfor the approach can be application dependent. Such factors must be\\nwell-attributed to attain better solutions. The limitation of degeneracy,\\ni.e., multiple chromosomes representing the same solution, can degrade\\nthe possibility of having efficient solutions and therefore, finding opti-\\nmal patterns in the complex stock market using GA may not converge\\ncompletely and the derived solutions may lack optimality [167]. Also,\\nthe required execution time using GAs is generally high which, in turn,\\ncan have an adverse effect on its efficiency [158].\\nAn enhanced approach, GP, was developed as an iterative tree-based\\nrepresentation. It can be considered for generating trading signals, how-\\never, stock price prediction has not been significantly addressed. How-\\never, GP encounters limitations while working with constraint-based\\ncomplex relationships. This may be a concern for portfolio optimization\\ntasks where different assets and their correlations with other influential\\nfactors need to be considered for optimal portfolio construction. Also,\\nother genetic perspectives such as GP, GEP, GNP are relatively less\\nexplored for the field of financial markets.\\nIt can be observed from the reviewed literature that the rationale\\nbehind selection of a specific strategy is not clearly anticipated. Though\\nspecifications about the selection approach, crossover and mutation\\nmethods, as well as their rates, are provided, the intuition(s) behind\\nsuch adopted combinations are given less attention. Similarly, one or\\nmore datasets are taken for the experiment, however, the rationale\\nbehind choosing a specific dataset as well as the time duration for\\nwhich the experiment is carried out are not clearly mentioned. Hence, a\\ncomparative study among such diversely carried out experiments may\\nbe difficult.\\nSome of the other challenges may include identification of influen-\\ntial facets of the stock market and incorporation of the financial aspects.\\nThe non-linear behaviours can be analysed with the associated social,\\neconomical, political, national as well as international, and emotional\\nfactors of traders, investors, and related parties. Also, little attention\\nhas been given to economics-related fiscal matters. Identification and\\ninclusion of such real-world features and derivation of their application\\nusing metaheuristics may be beneficial for the stock market prediction.\\n8.2. Potential Future Research Directions\\nTo develop reliable stock market predictions, the existing limita-\\ntions need to be addressed. Some of the potential future research\\ndirections may be considered as follows.\\nIt has been observed that beyond the large search space capability,\\nGAs suffer premature convergence in a local optimum. GAs may be\\nadapted with alternate tuning which may aid to avoid such prema-\\nture convergence [168]. An improvement was proposed to reduce the\\ndefinition interval and calculate crossover probabilities with a scale\\nfactor [168]. Authors showed these factors to have a direct influence\\non speed as well as convergence of a GA; similar enhancements may\\nalso be developed for operators such as mutation.\\nThough standard selection strategies are largely followed, the same\\nmay not be suitable for the given problem definition. Understanding\\nthe targeted stock market dataset and inherent characteristics may\\nbe useful in selecting appropriate algorithm variables. Also, develop-\\ning a rationale behind choosing a specific operator may be benefi-\\ncial for deeper understanding, re-development, and enhancement of\\nthe proposed work. Subsequently, other approaches can be integrated\\nbased on the market characteristics to identify useful features through\\nintegration of coefficient of variation-based properties for enhanced\\nforecasting performances [169]. On the other hand, the data can be\\nfused to extract useful information through quantization [170] and the\\nsame can be further provided to the optimized prediction model for\\nstock price and trend prediction.\\nThough different aspects of the financial market have been consid-\\nered, other influential factors may have been given limited attention;\\nfor example, opinion-based forecasting, sentiment analysis for market\\n\\nComputer Science Review 53 (2024) 100652\\n23\\nA. Thakkar and K. Chaudhari\\ntrend identification, the impact of social media and/or news. Such\\nevents may introduce drastic changes in the market trend; other learn-\\ning approaches have evaluated stock market under such influence,\\nhowever, limited research works have applied GA and/or GP-based\\ntechniques for improving the predictions, which can be one of the\\npromising future directions. A series of experimental analyses can\\nbe carried out in the future for demonstrating the impact of GA as\\nwell as its subsequent variants in solving stock market prediction\\nchallenges. Also, the companies having been listed on multiple stock\\nexchanges can provide important information about the market be-\\nhaviours [13,171]. Such factors can be further explored using GAs\\nas well as other metaheuristics to recommend potential investment\\nstrategies. It can be considered as another potential directive where\\ngenetic perspectives can be utilized for multiple exchanges to enhance\\nportfolio diversification.\\nThe slower convergence or possibility of being trapped into local\\nminima using GAs may be improved by enhancing multi-objective or\\nparallel approach [172]. Also, the genetic operators can be fine-tuned\\nfor developing stronger optimization models. It may also be considered\\nto hybridize GAs with other swarm and evolutionary computation for\\nstock market prediction [154]. It can be observed that fusion tech-\\nniques have a significant implication on stock market predictions [173];\\nthe flexibility of various genetic perspectives can be utilized for poten-\\ntial fusion with other metaheuristics to further enhance the prediction\\nperformance.\\n9. Concluding Remarks\\nInvestment in a stock market demands knowledge of market be-\\nhaviours, trading strategies, technical as well as fundamental analyses.\\nIt can be beneficial as well as detrimental and trading should be\\ncarried out carefully. Because of the complexity and non-linearity of the\\nstock market, many researchers have proposed prediction techniques\\nfor future stock prices, movement direction, portfolio selection, profit\\nreturns, and various relevant aspects. In this article, we have studied\\nGA-based recent advances in stock price and stock trend prediction.\\nThe applicability of these techniques has been broadly categorized\\ninto parameter optimization, feature selection, and hybrid approaches\\nincluding classification and regression. We have studied how such algo-\\nrithms have been applied to forecast stock market behaviour. It can be\\nobserved that GAs have been applied to a large number of stock market-\\nrelated forecasting applications, whereas other genetic perspectives\\nhave been limited to specific domains such as trend prediction and\\nportfolio optimization.\\nThe stock market fluctuations are likely to occur throughout the\\ntrading period. Such variations and related patterns may be significant\\nin understanding the market behaviour and hence, predicting future\\nstocks. It could be observed that patterns-based market analysis could\\nbe further evaluated and optimized using genetic approaches. Also, fac-\\ntors associated with outcomes of an investment such as risk assessment,\\nas well as stock exchange-based internal aspects may be considered to\\ndevelop an efficient prediction system. Along with the market analysis,\\ninvestors’ profiles can be helpful for constructing a personalized pre-\\ndiction. Though we have restricted our survey to stock price and stock\\ntrend prediction, portfolio optimization may be one of the interesting\\nresearch topics. It can be seen that only a few evolutionary computa-\\ntion methods have been integrated with GA; the performance may be\\nimproved by controlling the shortcomings of one approach with the\\nhelp of another approach(es). Stock market data is continuous whereas\\nGA works with binary string representation; to enhance the prediction\\naccuracy, other bio-inspired approaches such as PSO can be integrated\\nto deal with such continuous data. Hence, the existing competitiveness\\nof such metaheuristics and complementation of GAs have also been\\npresented as part of our survey. We have reviewed the shortcomings\\nof GAs and discussed potential future research directions. It can be\\nobserved that the development of ensembled approaches is useful to\\nconstruct reliable stock prediction models.\\nThis article is aimed to provide a focused survey covering GAs\\nand related genetic perspectives such as GP, GNP, GEP with recent\\nupdates from years 2013 to 2022 as well as challenges and future\\ndirections. Also, experimental analyses have been provided to compare\\nand demonstrate the usefulness of GA; the same can be useful in further\\nexpansion of integrating other metaheuristics as well as proposing\\nfusion-based techniques. It may encourage interested researchers in\\nextending the research work for solving potential issues in predicting\\nstock market. The inherent relationships and dependencies within stock\\nmarkets may be useful for market analysis. Deep learning has given\\npromising results for stock predictions [174], however, it could be\\nobserved that a limited number of deep learning-based techniques\\nwere applied with GA and/or GP optimization; detailed study of such\\npotential extensions may bring improvement in stock trend prediction.\\nDeclaration of competing interest\\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing finan-\\ncial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to\\ninfluence the work reported in this paper.\\nData availability\\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.\\nReferences\\n[1] A.

       "'Ever wondered if the stock market\\'s wild swings could be predicted with the precision of a weather forecast?  A recent research paper, \"Applicability of genetic algorithms for stock market prediction: A systematic survey of the last decade,\" dives into this very question, exploring how a nature-inspired algorithm – the genetic algorithm (GA) – can help us decipher the market\\'s cryptic signals.\\n\\nThe research problem is simple yet profound:  Stock market prediction is notoriously difficult.  Traditional methods often fall short, leaving investors vulnerable to unpredictable losses.  The paper argues that the inherent complexity and non-linearity of the market demand adaptable, intelligent methods.  This is where GAs, inspired by the principles of natural selection, come into play.  They offer a powerful way to optimize prediction models by automatically tuning parameters and selecting the most relevant features from a vast pool of data.  This matters because more accurate predictions can lead to better investment decisions, potentially minimizing risk and maximizing returns.\\n\\nThe key findings reveal a fascinating interplay between GAs and various machine learning techniques.  The paper systematically reviews a decade\\'s worth of research, showing how GAs have been used to optimize parameters in neural networks (like MLPs and LSTMs), improve feature selection for models like SVMs and Random Forests, and even directly optimize portfolio strategies.  The implications are significant: GAs can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of existing prediction models, potentially leading to more reliable forecasts.  Furthermore, the survey explores other genetic algorithms like Genetic Programming (GP), Gene Expression Programming (GEP), and Genetic Network Programming (GNP), highlighting their potential but also their relative under-exploration in the field.\\n\\nHere are some discussion-worthy questions to spark a lively podcast conversation:\\n\\n1. **The \"No Free Lunch\" Theorem:** The paper acknowledges the \"No Free Lunch\" theorem, stating that no single optimization algorithm is universally superior.  Given this, how can we determine the best approach for stock market prediction, and what factors should guide our choice of algorithm (GA, PSO, etc.)?  Should we focus on hybrid approaches?\\n\\n2. **Interpretability vs. Accuracy:**  Many complex machine learning models, while accurate, lack interpretability.  How important is it to understand *why* a model makes a particular prediction, especially in high-stakes financial markets?  Do GA-based methods offer a better balance between accuracy and interpretability compared to other techniques?\\n\\n3. **Beyond Price Prediction:** The paper touches on portfolio optimization and trading rule generation.  How can GAs be further leveraged to address other crucial aspects of financial decision-making, such as risk management, hedging strategies, and the incorporation of qualitative factors (news, sentiment)?\\n\\nFor a graphical abstract, consider a visual representation of the key findings.  A flowchart showing the different ways GAs are integrated into stock market prediction models (parameter optimization, feature selection, hybrid models) would be impactful.  Another compelling visual could be a comparison chart showing the performance of GA-based models against other metaheuristics (PSO, ACO, etc.) across different evaluation metrics (MSE, MAPE, accuracy).  Finally, a timeline highlighting the growth of GA applications in stock market prediction over the last decade would provide a clear picture of the field\\'s evolution.  These visuals would make the complex research easily digestible for a podcast audience.'"
